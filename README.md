# RST
A small/tiny Cross Platform Audio Framework for Making/Programming Audio Plugins in C Code with GCC.
It can be used for making VST2 instruments/synthesizers and effects.

The focus is on small amout of code and understand and take control of your codebase.

Can compile for 32bit and 64bit versions of Windows and Linux on Linux or Windows.
And has been used to cross compile plugins for Windows on Linux.
It uses it's own API that is compatible with the VST2.4 ABI so the plugs can be used in the most amount of music programs and even older ones.

It will let you have code for several plugins in the same catalouge for convinience.
